# Responsive-nav-bar-sidebar-
This a simple-plain webpage with a background image and a nav bar for desktop with media queries. For tablets and smart phones the nav bar is shorter so we create a menu button which, when clicked opens a sidebar. Has index.html, style.css and script.js files and comments to identify the elements. The icons in this webpage are exported from google.
